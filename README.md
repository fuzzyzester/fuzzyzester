### Welcome to my Github profile! I'm an enthusiastic explorer of the captivating worlds of Data Science and sustainability. üöÄüå±

With a strong analytical skill set and a result-driven personality, I'm currently studying Data Science at EC Utbildning, where I'm passionate about uncovering hidden insights and making exciting discoveries with data. I'm also deeply committed to driving sustainability initiatives.

In my program, I'm gaining expertise in Business Analytics, Statistics, SQL & Database, R and Python Programming, Data Analysis & Visualization (Power BI & Tableau), Big Data, Business Intelligence, Data Warehousing, Machine Learning, and Data Storytelling.

Furthermore, I bring a background in master data management, business process improvement, and international customer service. I've had the privilege of being involved in a global migration project, implementing ERP systems within SAP and Oracle.

Beyond my love for data, I'm driven by a passion for sustainability. I believe in harnessing the power of data to drive positive change and contribute to a more sustainable future. Let's connect and explore the endless possibilities of data-driven sustainability together! Join me on this exciting journey as we unlock the power of data and work towards a greener, more sustainable world.!
